      <h2 id="history">History of SSTO Concepts</h2>
      <p>Several initial ssto concepts were proposed during the space race in the sixties but were ultimately cut due to the fact that they simply weren't feasible yet. Engines weren't powerful enough, fuel was too heavy, and materials weren't strong enough.</p>

      <h2 id="technology">Key Technologies</h2>
      <p>SSTO stands for single stage to orbit and many of the concepts today resemble planes as that is currently the most efficient way to get to a high altitude. After they reach a certain altitude, oxygen becomes scarce so they have to switch to liquid oxygen fuels to continue climbing into outer space. At this point the lift generated by the wings is incredibly small but they still climb at a reasonable angle to keep their orbit safe and predictable.</p>

      <h2 id="challenges">Challenges and Obstacles</h2>
      <p>Currently the biggest challenge is creating an engine that is capable of running off of the oxygen in the atmosphere and liquid oxygen at higher altitudes while being efficient enough to make the cost investment for a reusable space craft actually feasible.</p>

      <h2 id="current">Current Projects and Research</h2>
      <p>There have been few projects that were recent. Most being in the 2010s. This is due in part to space X's recent success with reusable spacecraft. It is essentially a working stopgap to the problem that plane based sstos were meant to solve. </p>

      <h2 id="future">The Future of SSTO</h2>
      <p>The biggest boon for sstos would be the creation of a powerful and safe ion engine that would be capable of propelling it for long periods to other planets or missions so that it can save solid fuel for landing on other planets. More efficient and powerful solid fuel engines would also be a great help.</p>
